No installation required. As long as you have Python3 installed

and sympy), you can run this program with `python acap.py`. Or make it
as an executable and put it in your PATH.

## Example inputs

- sin(2.3) * 5!
- h
- m_e c^2  (then input MeV as user-defined unit)
- m_e c^2 / h  
- (G M_sun / au)^.5 (define output units as km/s)
- e.esu^2 / (0.1 nm)^2
