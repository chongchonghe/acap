* How to run?

No installation is required. As long as you have a python3 installed
(not tested on python2) with the required modules (astropy, tkinter,
and sympy), you can run this program with ~python acap.py~. Or make it
as an executable and put it in your PATH.

* Example inputs

- sin(2.3)
- h
- m_e c^2  (then input MeV as user-defined unit)
- m_e c^2 / h  
- (G M_sun / au)^.5 (define output units as km/s)
- e.esu^2 / (0.1 nm)^2
